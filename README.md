# Overview

This project is being developed using Cursor via the o3 model. To build from the first commit the following prompts have been used for each of the days thus far.

## Prompts used to get started

### 07/01/25

Using the program specification found in the spec.md markdown file:
* Follow the rules from the `Rules` section
* With the data from the `Data provided` section
* Follow the instructions in the 'What to do` section to build the described command line utility.

### 07/02/25

Using the program specification found in the spec.md markdown file:
* Follow the rules from the `Rules` section
* With the data from the `Data provided` section
* Follow the instructions in the 'What to do` section to build and containerize the described command line utility 

### 07/03/25

Using the program specification found in the spec.md markdown file:
* Follow the rules from the `Rules` section
* With the data from the `Data provided` section
* Follow the instructions in the 'What to do` section to build and containerize the described command line utility 

### Notes

* The mistake of the ' usage versus the ` usage around What to do is an accurate representation of what was utilized although obviously mismatched.

## TODO

* Include a prompt text file to allow for code generation from spec.md at each commit of the spec.md file.
* Fix the prompt used via matching `'s around What to do
